# McDonald's Case Study Replication

## Description:
This project replicates a McDonald's case study using Python. It involves data preprocessing, PCA for dimensionality reduction, KMeans clustering for segment identification, segment profiling, and decision tree classification for marketing segmentation.

## Project Structure:
- `mcdonalds.csv`: Dataset containing customer feedback on McDonald's products.
- `replication_mcdonalds.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for replication.
- `README.md`: Description of the project.
- `requirements.txt`: File containing the required Python libraries for replication.

## Instructions:
1. Install Python and required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Open and run `replication_mcdonalds.ipynb` in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
3. Follow the code step-by-step to replicate the McDonald's case study.
4. Ensure the dataset `mcdonalds.csv` is in the correct directory.
